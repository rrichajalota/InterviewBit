/*  Count Element Occurence

    Given a sorted array of integers, find the number of occurrences of a given target value.
    Your algorithmâ€™s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
    If the target is not found in the array, return 0

    Example : 
    Given [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10] and target value 8,
    return 2.
