/*  2-Sum Binary 
    Given a binary search tree T, where each node contains a positive integer, and an integer K, you have to find whether or not there exist two different nodes A and B such that A.value + B.value = K.
    Return 1 to denote that two such nodes exist. Return 0, otherwise.
    Notes 
    - Your solution should run in linear time and not take memory more than O(height of T).
    - Assume all values in BST are distinct.

    Example :
    Input 1: 

    T :       10
             / \
            9   20

    K = 19
    Return: 1

    Input 2: 
    T:        10
             / \
            9   20

    K = 40
    Return: 0

/*  SOLUTION APPROACH
    How would we solve with O(N) memory? Letâ€™s say you are given a sorted array and you need to find two indices i < j, such that A[i] + A[j]= k. Relate between a sorted array and a BST. Avoid O(N) memory and do with O(height) memory. <stack>

    If we do inorder traversal of BST we visit elements in increasing order. So, we use a two pointer approach, where we keep two pointers pt1 and pt2. Initially pt1 is at smallest value and pt2 at largest value.

    Then we compare sum = pt1.value + pt2.value. If sum < target, we increase pt2, else we decrease pt2 until we reach target.
